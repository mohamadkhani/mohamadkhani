# Mohammad Khani

With 13 years of experience in software development and project
management, I am constantly learning and adapting to new
technologies. I prioritize selecting the best tools and programming
languages, even when they require extra effort. My key interests
include software architecture, innovative systems, and tackling complex
challenges.

I am committed to implementing the right principles and best
methodologies, as I believe rushed development leads to long-term
inefficiencies and continuous bug fixing. Currently, I focus on EDA
(Event-Driven Architecture), Kafka, Apache Flink, Go, ArangoDB,
Node.js, Kubernetes, DevOps tools, and React.js.
